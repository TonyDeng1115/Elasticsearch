Index and query a document
PUT /customer/_doc/1?pretty
{
  "name": "John Doe"
}
GET /customer/_doc/1?pretty

Delete an index
DELETE /customer?pretty

If we study the above commands carefully, we can actually see a pattern of how we access data in Elasticsearch. That pattern can be summarized as follows:
<HTTP Verb> /<Index>/<Type>/<ID>

This example returns all accounts containing the term "mill" or "lane" in the address:

GET /bank/_search
{
  "query": { "match": { "address": "mill lane" } }
}
COPY AS CURLVIEW IN CONSOLE 
This example is a variant of match (match_phrase) that returns all accounts containing the phrase "mill lane" in the address:

GET /bank/_search
{
  "query": { "match_phrase": { "address": "mill lane" } }
}
